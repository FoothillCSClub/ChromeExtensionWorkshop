### Hello World
The simplest extension possible, that has an icon ([browser action](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/browserAction)) and a popup when you click it.

### Text Replacer 1
Introducing the [content script](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts), this extension replaces all instances of the word "apple" with "orange" in all web pages.

### Text Replacer 2
Introducing [message passing](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/messaging) and [Chrome storage](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/storage), this extension allows the find and replace phrases to be configured in the popup, and communicates changes to the [background](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/background_pages) and content scripts.
